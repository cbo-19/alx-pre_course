My first readme

Coding is not easy especially working with ALX

Marathon is the word that can be used to describe ALX Software Engineering

-There are a lot of projects given during the week

-You need to do a alot of research to be able to complete the projects which can be exhausting and frustrating at times

However, from the study of growth mindset and grit, I am going to persevere through this program;

1 With the help of The Holy Spirit

2 Adopting a growth mindset where I adopt different strategies and processes coupled with my effort to solve varying tasks

Nevertheless, I thank ALX for accepting a newbie like me in software engineering and willing to groom me into a software developer at no fee

I will not give up but I will do my very best with the help of the Holy Spirit to become a solution in Africa.
